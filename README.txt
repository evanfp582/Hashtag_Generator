Hashtag Generator Coding Exam For SandBox Union
Made By: Evan Fisher-Perez

Description:
  The JavaScript function named hashtagGenerator in the hashtag_generator.js file first 
  asks the user for a string to be turned into a hashtag and then either returns the finished hashtag or false if an error was reached
  hashtagGenerator returns false when user inputs empty string (or a string with just whitespace) or after formatting, the hashtag is greater then 140 chars

To Execute: 
  Prerequisites: Node.js
  type: 'Node .\hashtag_generator.js'

Thought Process:
  I believe that a quick and easy terminal program would be the simplest way to develop and test this code
  Spinning up a quick web application would be straightforward, but I think it may make the assignment unnecessarily complex 

Assumptions Made:
  That the user should be promoted once, the input their string, their output is printed, and then the program stops executing. 
  The user should be prompted on the console asking for their input
